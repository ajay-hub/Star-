		<h1> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning </h1>
		<hr>
		<p> <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) </strong> can be defined as the development of computer systems which can perform tasks, such as recognizing patterns and pictures, understanding language, learning from experience, at par with human intelligence. Now, the question arises how do we define “intelligence”? Intelligence is the ability to learn, understand, and make judgments based on reason. It can also be defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge to real-world scenarios.<br><br>This concept of “intelligence” forms the basis for the domain of AI. The idea of an “intelligent” machine was first introduced by Alan Turing in the year 1950 when he proposed a test known as “imitation game”, which is better known as Turing Test. It was aimed to check whether the machine is “intelligent” or not.</p>
