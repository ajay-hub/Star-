		<p> <img class="img" src="https://cdnmedia.starcertification.org/Content/Images/Poster/10015.png" height="360px" width="340px" align="right">More and more, we are seeing technology as well as enterprises moving to the cloud â€” an internet-based computing. Cloud computing powers the services of internet giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, and companies like Dropbox, Amazon and Netflix exist only because of cloud technologies. Cloud computing relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. Cloud computing providers provide their services in three standard models like Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure a Service (laaS).<br><br>Star Cloud Computing is a training course that explains various cloud computing and virtualization concepts and goes on to discuss the popular cloud providers like Google, Amazon, etc. in great details, focusing on their differentiators. The course then discusses the various cloud computing models, their associated risks and pricing implications, while understanding the quality considerations therein.<br><br>The course further gives additional information about backup solutions and security features and sets about stating facts and debunking popular myths. And as it concludes, the course talks about the cloud implementation aspect in detail, making way for easier practical learning. Star Cloud Computing offers basic to advance-level of guidance to learners of all categories, in a detailed and simplified approach to ease and speed up the learning process.</p>
