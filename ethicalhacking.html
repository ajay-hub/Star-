		<h1> Ethical Hacking </h1>
		<hr>
		<p> <img class="img" src="https://cdnmedia.starcertification.org/Content/Images/Poster/10020.png" height="360px" width="340px" align="right">The number of devastating cyberattacks is increasing, — and it's likely to get much worse. Constantly growing adoption of the mobile Internet, cloud computing, and IoT have expanded the attack landscape, making cyber security the top of the agenda. This ominous need has increased the demand of ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals, and these jobs are expected to grow at a rate of 37% till 2022.<br><br><strong>Star Ethical Hacking Expert </strong> is a comprehensive training program that helps learners acquire a fundamental understanding of concepts like information security, hacking, and ethical hacking, and is a must-have guide for any IT security professional. This program covers discusses both basic as well as advanced hacking tools and techniques used by hackers and information security professionals alike, to break into an organization’s information system.  In this program, the learner will understand the logic behind hacking and the ways in which hackers go about it, thus enabling you to prevent any such acts. As they say,<em><strong> “Prevention is better than cure!” </strong></em><br><br>This program makes the learners aware and in charge of their systems and allows them to test, uncover, hack and fix vulnerabilities, and stay in complete control of their information. The program proceeds with detailing the process of hacking in five consequential stages including investigation, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering your tracks.</p>
