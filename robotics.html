		<p> <img class="img" src="https://cdnmedia.starcertification.org/Content/Images/Poster/10039.png" height="360px" width="340px" align="right">There's a lot of buzz around robotics technologies at the moment. As a scientific field, robotics helps us build devices that can physically interact with their environment. For example, robots that work alongside us and seemingly omniscient digital assistants that we increasingly rely on to perform different tasks. The need for robotics engineer exists across industries like healthcare, transportation, insurance, logistics and even customer service.<br><br><strong>Star Robotics Pre </strong> is a foundation-level certification program that aims to help learners acquire a fundamental understanding of all the aspects of robotics including designing, prototyping, analysis, basic coding, electronic circuitry, control systems, etc. The program covers everything robotics starting from history of robotics, to classification of robots, to sensors, actuators, drivers and control systems, further to mechanical design of robots and robot operating system (ROS), and more.<br><br>The purpose of this certification program is to build the interest of the learners in this immensely lucrative field of robotics where there is an increasing requirement for robotics engineers. With this certification candidates get an opportunity to work in the field of robotics and later if they want to learn advance skills, then they can opt for the advanced-level course, which is Star Robotics Pro.</p>
